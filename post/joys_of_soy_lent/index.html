<p>This week I went through a life change, one most will probably call me a bit nuts for. I decided to go full time with Soylent. Just to be clear, by full time I mean I&rsquo;m eating it daily, but it&rsquo;s not all I&rsquo;m eating during the day. I eat Soylent for breakfast and lunch, but I still sit down and have dinner with my family. I do this for a number of reasons that I won&rsquo;t go into, but lets just say full time Soylent isn&rsquo;t an option for me at this time.</p>

<p>My first day was on Wednesday, and it was quite the shift from my normal day. I&rsquo;m not one to normally eat during the day, especially at work, so having <em>food</em> during the day was different. Different in a good way though. I felt like I had more energy to complete tasks. I&rsquo;m not sure it was a measurable difference in my productivity, but this is something I should have done a long time ago. I didn&rsquo;t receive any strange looks like I expected to, and things were fine, surprisingly.</p>

<p>I finished up about 32 ounces of the pitcher, which I had mixed the night before, which I highly recommend. This works out to be about 1000 kcal or so. I&rsquo;m a pretty big guy and going with about a 500 kcal deficit and planning on about 1000 calories from dinner alone, which probably isn&rsquo;t that far from accurate considering what I usually have for dinner.</p>

<p>I should note, though, that I didn&rsquo;t <em>switch</em> to Soylent because I wanted to lose weight, I just figured I might as well cut the calories during the day and quit snacking at night, might be a nice side effect. Soylent was to get me eating during the day again, and not snacking all night to &ldquo;make up&rdquo; for the missed calories, which I would do and then some.</p>

<p>For my life, this seems like a good fit so far, and I&rsquo;m going to order more, for sure. I started with a small batch just to make sure it was what I wanted. the tl;dr for this is it exactly what I was looking for. Now the review!</p>

<h1 id="taste">Taste</h1>

<p>When it comes to taste, it is honestly pretty bland. The description of sweet oatmeal or pancake batter are pretty close. So far I haven&rsquo;t noticed any grittyness which was one of the things I was worried about. It goes down pretty similar to a milk shake, just don&rsquo;t expect it to taste like one! As I said the taste is pretty bland, but my taste buds have become accustom already to this, and while I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m looking forward to it, it&rsquo;s satisfying to the point where I&rsquo;m going to keep going.</p>

<h1 id="texturea">Texturea</h1>

<p>As I said above, the texture isn&rsquo;t anywhere near as gritty as expected, but there is a bit. It is very much like a milkshake, which is good. The one thing I can recommend is letting it sit over night in the fridge before consuming. this has worked out really well so far, and I&rsquo;m honestly not willing to try it any other way at this time. If it ain&rsquo;t broke don&rsquo;t fix it amirite?</p>

<h1 id="portability">Portability</h1>

<p>For moving the Soylent around, I&rsquo;m using a Nalgene wide mouth bottle. This holds exactly what I need for during the day. I was bringing the pitcher back and forth to work, but I found that it doesn&rsquo;t quite seal all the way, so that wasn&rsquo;t the greatest idea. It worked, but I  wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it if you can avoid it.</p>

<h1 id="thought-so-far">Thought So Far</h1>

<p>For now, this will be my fuel for the day. I&rsquo;m going to write up another post for next Tuesday to give my thoughts on having been on Soylent for a week, and to see if I feel anything is missing. I&rsquo;ve thought about at least adding a protein powder, but we&rsquo;ll see. For now though, things will stay just pure Soylent.</p>

<h1 id="full-disclosure">Full Disclosure</h1>

<p>I did not receive any money or discount or anything else for that matter for writing this.</p>

<p>Also, I am taking a fish oil suppliment, but I may stop, as I don&rsquo;t think I need it anymore, but only time will tell.</p>

<p>Stay Tuned!</p>
