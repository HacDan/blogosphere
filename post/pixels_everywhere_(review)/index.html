<h1 id="perfect-well-almost">Perfect! (Well, almost)</h1>

<p>So, as stated, everything arrived on time on Tuesday. I unboxed this beast and went to work installing the set of apps that I figured I would need. We&rsquo;ll get to the software side of things in the next post, for now, let&rsquo;s talk about hardware.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the actual tablet. The device is solid, screen resolution and aspect ratio is perfect for what I wanted to use it for, which is mainly editing text files and doing research. For that, it&rsquo;s perfect. The screen is a bit of a fingerprint magnet, but a wipe down once a day seems to eliminate that.</p>

<p>One of the flaws I&rsquo;ve found so far with the hardware is a pretty common one. Just below and to the left of the center of the screen, there&rsquo;s a noticable give in the screen. I would have never found this if I hadn&rsquo;t had known it was something to look for. I&rsquo;m not planning on sending the device back for this flaw, though, as it&rsquo;s something that I don&rsquo;t notice during normal use. The power and volume buttons are positioned perfect for my taste, and they are very tactile, which I was hoping for. Sometimes buttons are an easy place to cut corners on, but on this device, no expese seemed to be spared.</p>

<p>The lightbar, while it may seem gimmicky, has proved to be quite useful. I&rsquo;ve used it to check the battery while I have the tablet sitting on it&rsquo;s face and charging. Maybe I&rsquo;m only using it because I know it exists, I&rsquo;m honestly not sure, but for now, it&rsquo;s quite useful.</p>

<p>Another downfall that relates to hardware, but was obviously easy to fix was the device showed up at my door, with a flat battery. I had watched a few unboxings on YouTube and noticed the tablet normally booted right up when removed from the plastic wrapping, mine did not and honestly my heart sank. I&rsquo;ve received my fair share of duds over the years,and normally having them replaced by the manufacturer isn&rsquo;t an issue, and I doubt it would have been an issue with Google, but I&rsquo;m leaving for vacation on Monday and I don&rsquo;t think it would have made it here on time. Thankfully after plugging the tablet it, it started to boot right up. The day was saved!</p>

<h1 id="keyboard-woes">Keyboard Woes</h1>

<p>Now, the keyboard was the only part of the hardware I was honestly really worried about. I had always planned on using the device with an external keyboard, but that doeesn&rsquo;t mean that I don&rsquo;t want to use the ridiculously expensive accessory that I purchased with this thing. So, what do I think? Well&hellip; it&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m more impressed than I expected to be, but I have had to remap some bindings to make full use of it. No escape key isn&rsquo;t an issue, but lacking in brackets has really forced me back into using snippets for most things, which while it&rsquo;s not bad thing, it has proven to slow me down a bit. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll improve over time of using them, but for now, this is proving to be an issue while mobile.</p>

<p>Now, the keys that do exist on the keyboard feel awesome, lots of travel, yet they don&rsquo;t need to be pushed that far to register a click. It&rsquo;s honestly noiser than expected, but far from as noisey as my DAS. All in all, the keyboard is awesome and while I do have my issues with it, I&rsquo;m not dissapointed, and it&rsquo;s not going back.</p>

<h1 id="worth-it">Worth it?</h1>

<p>Well, is it worth the high price tag that Google is charging for it? I think so, without any doubt. The hardware alone is quite close to perfect, feels great in the hand, and is well engineered. The software, while it is Android, I think is well suited for this tablet, but I&rsquo;ll get into that more next week. Hardware wise though, I&rsquo;m keeping it, despite my few issues with it.</p>
